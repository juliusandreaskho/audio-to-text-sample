# audio-to-text-sample
This is my sample project of building a speech-to-text Machine Learning system using SVM Algorithm with Scikit-Learn Library. 
Feel free to contribute, to make the accuracy better than this. Thank You :)

To execute the program, please ONLY run the "machine_train_wavestruct.py" and then "audio_to_text.py".
Feel free to learn from, give feedback to this repo, and Enjoy the Program :)

Note:
The file "svc_machine_train.py" contains the documentation of the experiments which still have many errors.
Since the "audio_to_text_google.py" was the experiments I made using Google TTS service.
